# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository serves as the foundation for the Requirement Analysis phase of a software project. It is part of the "FeatureForge: Crafting Your Project Blueprint" initiative, focusing on the documentation and analysis of system requirements.

The goal is to simulate a real-world airbnb booking management system project and create a comprehensive blueprint that includes functional and non-functional requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria. This work lays the groundwork for efficient, scalable, and successful software development.
